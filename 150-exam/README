There are three exam sets:

1. exam2018.scala.pdf from 2018 spring (along with the corresponding
   exam2018.scala file and, spoiler alert, exam2018solutions.scala file).  This is
   the exam actually used in Spring 2018 in this course.


1. exam2017.scala.pdf from 2017 (along with the corresponding exam2017.scala
   file and, spoiler alert, exam2017solutions.scala file).  This is the exam
   actually used in 2017 in this course.


2. exam2016.scala.pdf from 2016 (along with the corresponding exam2016.scala
   file and, spoiler alert, exam2016solutions.scala file).  This is the exam
   actually used in 2016 in this course.

3. src/main/scala/examFake.scala (along with the corresponding solutions).
   This is a trial exam prepared in 2016.  It has the same scope and size as an
   actual exam. This one was never typeset in the PDF file, but all the questions
   are in comments.

The build.sbt file and the library implementation files for these exams.
