/**
 * Advanced Programming.  Fake exam 2016.  This set of exam questions have been
 * prepared as a demonstration before the first written exam has been used in
 * ADPRO.
 */


/**
 * The questions will be greaded  manually.
 *
 * I do not recommend solving questions in an IDE to the point when they compile
 * and work (at least not until you have drafted all the answers).
 *
 * We will  be permissive  on small  syntactic issues  (semicolons, punctuation,
 * small deviations in  function names, switching between  curried and uncurried
 * parameters, unless  the question is about  currying, etc).
 *
 * We  will also  not check  whether the  type inference  succeeded (if  a human
 * reader could infer types).
 *
 * If you insert your answers in a  separate document remember to write the task
 * number before each answer, and answer questions  in the same order as in this
 * document.
 *
 * You can use any functions from the course (textbook, exercises) in your
 * solutions.
 *
 * You can use the provided build.sbt file to compile the exam. The same file
 * will work for the exam (but you might need to include some fpinscala files in
 * src/ if you use other functions in your solutions).  In general compiling
 * during a 4 hour exam is not recommended, as dependency problems can take all
 * your time.  But you are welcomed to do it, if you already solved all the
 * questions without compiling.
